## Abstract

The Transformer–convolutional neural network (CNN) hybrid learning approach is gaining traction for balancing deep and shallow image features for hierarchical semantic segmentation. However, they are still confronted with a contradiction between comprehensive semantic understanding and meticulous detail extraction. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel Transformer–CNN hybrid hierarchical network, dubbed contourlet transformer (CoT). In the CoT framework, the semantic representation process of the Transformer is unavoidably peppered with sparsely distributed points that, while not desired, demand finer detail. Therefore, we design a deep detail representation (DDR) structure to investigate their fine-grained features. First, through contourlet transform (CT), we distill the high-frequency directional components from the raw image, yielding localized features that accommodate the inductive bias of CNN. Second, a CNN deep sparse learning (DSL) module takes them as input to represent the underlying detailed features. This memory-and energy-efficient learning method can keep the same sparse pattern between input and output. Finally, the decoder hierarchically fuses the detailed features with the semantic features via an image reconstruction-like fashion. Experiments demonstrate that CoT achieves competitive performance on three benchmark datasets: PASCAL Context 57.21% mean intersection over union (mIoU), ADE20K (54.16% mIoU), and Cityscapes (84.23% mIoU). Furthermore, we conducted robustness studies to validate its resistance against various sorts of corruption.
