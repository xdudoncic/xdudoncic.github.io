## Abstract

The advent of the sixth generation of mobile communications (6G) ushers in an era of height- ened demand for advanced network intelligence to tackle the challenges of an expanding network landscape and increasing service demands. Deep Learning (DL), as a crucial technique for instilling intelligence into 6G, has demonstrated powerful and promising development. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the pivotal role of DL in 6G, exploring the myriad opportunities and challenges that arise. Firstly, we present a detailed vision for DL in 6G, emphasizing areas such as adaptive resource allocation, intelligent network management, robust signal processing, ubiquitous edge intelligence, and endogenous security. Secondly, this paper reviews how DL models leverage their unique learning capabilities to solve complex service demands in 6G. The models discussed include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Transformer, Federated Learning (FL), and Meta Learning. Additionally, we examine the specific challenges each DL model faces within the 6G context. Moreover, we delve into the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), examining its development and impact within the 6G framework. Finally, this paper culminates in a detailed discussion of ten critical open problems in integrating DL with 6G, setting the stage for future research and development in this field.
