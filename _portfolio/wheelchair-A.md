Designed and implemented software and control circuits that enable patients with ALS to use eye motions to command their wheelchair and online household appliances.

## R&D Experience

It was arduous work to figure out how to design a circuit to receive the signal from the software and deliver an order to the wheelchair. However, I solved this dilemma by first recording the output voltage of the control circuit of the wheelchair in different motions. Then, I assembled a switching circuit that change the control voltage according to the signals sent by the computer. The next problem was how to make the program communicate with the circuit. For this, I used a microcontroller to process the signal sent from the computer serial port and output the corresponding voltage to change the state of the switching circuit, thus commanding the movement of the wheelchair. Eventually, we donated the wheelchair to the patient with ALS. This exciting project was reported by [China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/19/WS5cb98432a3104842260b7334.html) and several other media outlets, attracting widespread attention from the community.
