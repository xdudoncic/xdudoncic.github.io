Simulated students trajectories on campus and utilized the mathematical model to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the campus environment. Developed a mathematical model to predict the spread of COVID-19 according to studentsâ€™ activities and curriculum and tested the effects of various means to control the epidemic.

## R&D Experience

After analyzing the arrangement of labs, classrooms, and the students' courses schedules, I use the probability model, specifically the Gaussian distribution, to fit students' arrival time and trajectories. We eventually obtained interpersonal networks from the fitted data to anticipate the virus spreading pattern. After experimenting with different on-campus prevention policies, we concluded different spreading scales of the virus to find the most effective way to prevent students from being affected. And the conclusion is the same as the current policy in each country, i.e., to wear masks and timely quarantine, which are both effective methods to reduce the transmission rate. 

## Duration 
Mar, 2020 - Jun, 2020

## Social Impact
We donated the system to Sunzhen Hope Primary School, Weinan, Shaanxi to facilitate the staff manage students and adopt strategies in season.
